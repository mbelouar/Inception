## About

*Inception* is your gateway to Docker mastery at 1337. Our mission is to construct a service infrastructure using Docker, orchestrated by the enigmatic Docker Compose. Central to this mission is **NGINX**, standing as a sentinel accessible through port 443, revealing a network of hidden services. Here, NGINX collaborates with **WordPress**, driven by **php-fpm**, and communicates with **MariaDB**, the custodian of data.

The saga continues as **WordPress** and **MariaDB** etch their legacy within dedicated volumes, epitomizing data's permanence. Step into "Inception" â€“ where Docker's power orchestrates a symphony of services. Embark on a journey where containers hold secrets, networks weave connections, and volumes ensure persistence. Join us on this voyage of Docker discovery and mastery.

### Architecture and Requirements

- A Docker container with NGINX supporting TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 only.
- A Docker container with WordPress + php-fpm (installed and configured), excluding NGINX.
- A Docker container with MariaDB, excluding NGINX.
- A volume to store your WordPress database.
- A second volume to store your WordPress website files.
- A Docker network to connect your containers.

### Docker-related Terminology

**Docker**: An open-source platform that automates the development, shipping, and running of applications in isolated environments called containers. Containers package applications, libraries, dependencies, and configurations, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments.

**Container**: A standalone, lightweight, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, and libraries. Containers isolate applications from their environment, providing consistency and portability.

**Image**: A template that defines the environment and runtime for a container. It consists of a snapshot of a filesystem and configuration settings. Images are used to create container instances, ensuring consistent deployment across various stages of development.

**Dockerfile**: A text file containing instructions for building a Docker image. It defines the base image, sets up the environment, installs dependencies, and configures the application. Dockerfiles enable reproducible and automated image creation.

**Docker Compose**: A tool that allows you to define and manage multi-container Docker applications using a simple YAML file. It enables you to specify services, networks, volumes, and their interactions in a single configuration.

**Volume**: A persistent data storage mechanism provided by Docker. Volumes enable containers to store and share data with the host machine and other containers, even if the container is stopped or removed.

**Network**: A virtual network that facilitates communication between containers, enabling them to interact securely. Networks can be used to isolate containers, group them by project, or simulate complex network topologies.

**Registry**: A repository for Docker images. It serves as a centralized location to store, share, and distribute Docker images. Docker Hub is a popular public registry, but you can also set up private registries for internal use.

**Orchestration**: The management and coordination of multiple containers to work together as a single application. Docker orchestration tools like Docker Swarm and Kubernetes enable automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

**Compose File**: A YAML file used to define services, networks, and volumes for a Docker Compose application. It specifies the configuration and relationships of the containers within the application.

**Service**: In Docker Compose, a service refers to a container and its configuration settings defined in the Compose file. Services define how a container should be built, run, and connected to other containers.

### Project Directory Structure
    project-root/
    |-- srcs/
    |   |-- nginx/
    |   |-- wordpress/
    |   |-- mariadb/
    |   |-- ...
    |-- Makefile
    |-- docker-compose.yml
    |-- .env
    |-- README.md

-   `srcs/`: Folder containing Docker-related files for each service.
-   `Makefile`: Automates project setup and management tasks.
-   `docker-compose.yml`: Defines services, networks, and volumes using Docker Compose.
-   `.env`: Environment variables used in the project (Add a custom one according to your personal credentials)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and execute the Docker project on your local machine. This guide assumes you have Docker and Docker Compose installed. If not, you can download them from the official Docker website.

### Prerequisites

-   Docker: [Download and Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
-   Docker Compose: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Setting Up the Project

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
	```bash
		git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
		cd your-repo
2. Build the Docker images and set up the environment using the already made Makefile :
			
		make
	This command above will create and configure the required containers, networks, and volumes as defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
### Accessing the Services

Once the project is up and running, you can access the services through your web browser.

-   **WordPress Website**: Open your browser and navigate to `https://login.42.fr` (replace `login` with your actual login if you are a 42 school student otherwise change it just to `https://localhost` ).
### Stopping the Project

To stop and remove the project's containers, networks, and volumes, use the following command:

	make down

## Conclusion

By following this comprehensive guide, you're well-equipped to build and deploy a powerful Docker infrastructure for hosting a secure WordPress website. This project not only enhances your Docker skills but also provides practical insights into containerization and orchestration.
